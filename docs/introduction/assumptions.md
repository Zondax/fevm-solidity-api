A series of assumptions and suppositions have been established in order to assure the correct functionality of the libraries. If any of these are not met, 
we cannot guarantee the library will work as expected. 


- Filecoin actors API has been tested through the rust integration module located in the ref-fvm repository [:link:](https://github.com/Zondax/ref-fvm/tree/lola/fixes). 
The builtin-actors submodule [:link:](https://github.com/Zondax/filecoin-solidity/tree/master/testing) present in this repository is the latest version tested on. 
Any newer version could break the library functionality.
